# Example Package

This is a simple example package in order to learn how to send it to packages installer as PyPI. 
Basically, I copied a tutorial and uploaded. It will also be a reference of organization to me. 

## Important Links

I used the following links to learn how to upload something here:
*[PyPI Tutorial on how to packaging projects](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
*[Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
*[Site to choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/)

 Creating a test branch and test the merging concept.
